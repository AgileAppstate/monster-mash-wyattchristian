[Verse 1]
I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster, from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

[Chorus]
(He did the Mash) He did the Monster Mash
(The Monster Mash) It was a graveyard smash
(He did the Mash) It caught on in a flash
(He did the Mash) He did the Monster Mash

[Verse 2]
(Wa-ooh) From my laboratory in the castle east
(Wa-ooh) To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
(Wa-wa-ooh) The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
(Wa-ooh) To get a jolt from my electrodes

[Chorus]
(They did the Mash) They did the Monster Mash
(The Monster Mash) It was a graveyard smash
(They did the Mash) It caught on in a flash
(They did the Mash) They did the Monster Mash

[Bridge]
(Wa-ooh) The zombies were having fun (An-a-shoop)
(Wa-ooh) The party had just begun (An-a-shoop)
(Wa-ooh) The guests included Wolfman (An-a-shoop)
(Wa-ooh) Dracula, and his son

[Verse 3]
(Wa-ooh) The scene was rocking, all were digging the sounds
(Wa-ooh) Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
(Wa-wa-ooh) The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
(Wa-ooh) With their vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five"

[Chorus]
(They played the Mash) They played the Monster Mash
(The Monster Mash) It was a graveyard smash
(They played the Mash) It caught on in a flash
(They played the Mash) They played the Monster Mash
