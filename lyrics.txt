[Verse 1]
I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster, from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

[Chorus]
(He did the Mash) He did the Monster Mash
(The Monster Mash) It was a graveyard smash
(He did the Mash) It caught on in a flash
(He did the Mash) He did the Monster Mash
